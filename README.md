There are 3 components in this project:

* Dashboard.js - Contains 2 Forms to display the encoded and decoded string
* Result1.js - Displays the encoded string
* Result2.js - Displays the decoded string


On clicking the Encoded and Decoded button, a GET request is sent to the endpoint which returns the JSON object.
